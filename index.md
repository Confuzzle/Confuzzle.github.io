Now I'm postgraduate in [RAIL](https://rail.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), Robotics And Artificial Intelligence Lab which started in 1990 and is one of the earliest laboratories in China engaged in the research of robotics and artificial intelligence.  
My main research field includes high-performance control platform of industrial robots and collaborative robots, such as robot control platforms, robot teaching software development and trajectory planning algorithms.
